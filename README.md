random forests', written by Pushpendu Ghosh, Ariel Neufeld, Jajati Keshari Sahoo.
You can access to the paper through https://paperswithcode.com/paper/forecasting-directional-movements-of-stock.

The main proposal is to predict the up or down direction of stock prices, with Random Forest and LSTM.
Data used in the assignment is obtained from the open database, Yahoo Finance.

Due to equipment limit, this assignment is based on ten stocks from 2016.01.01 to 2019.12.31.
If you have GPU or Cloud Sever, you can enlarge the stock basket, and extend time period to increase the training and test dataset.
